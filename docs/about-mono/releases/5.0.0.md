CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are adopting
a new strategy to share code with .NET.   With this release we started this effort where the
code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.
